            <h2>As-Sunnah Foundation Mosque Complex</h2>
            <p>
              The mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
              him) was a center of many welfare besides offering prayers.
              Although Dhaka is a city of mosques, most of the mosques are
              limited to congregational prayers and Moktob (Morning kindergarten
              for the children to teach the Quran). As-Sunnah Foundation wants
              to build an ideal mosque in Dhaka, which will be dedicated to
              various charitable activities besides performing Salat. It
              includes regular religious education for people of different
              classes and professions, distribution of weekly summaries of
              khutba among the worshipers, opportunities to meet and get
              acquainted with the knowledgeable scholars, special corner for
              women and children, free primary health care for distressed
              patients and providing assistance in resolving family and personal
              disputes through counseling system. In-Sha-Allah there will be
              various activities including Musafirkhana (Inn) for the people who
              come to Dhaka for various temporary needs from the village.
            </p>
            <p>
              In-sha-Allah there will also be the head office of the As-Sunnah
              Foundation for all the charitable activities carried out across
              the country next to the mosque. From where the Foundation's
              countrywide mosques, madrasas and various services and
              humanitarian activities will be conducted.
